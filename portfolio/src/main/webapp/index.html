      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src = "images/me.jpeg"></img>
      <p>I'm Amber Xie, a current sophomore at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. I'm from the Bay Area, California, and my family comes from Inner Mongolia, a bilingual province in China.
          While my relatives are about as Chinese now as I am American, they have always held on strongly to their Monglian heritage, and it's shaped the person I am and the dreams I have.
      </p>
      <p>I'm an avid programmer and problem-solver. Some of my favorite topics in the tech space include probability and free speech on the internet.
          Outside of math and computer science, I really enjoy learning different languages. It gives me access to different forms of art: watching TV series in Spanish,
          listening to music in French, Chinese, and Mongolian, and watching movies in Italian. Some recommendations: Elite (Spanish teen thriller, great for picking up slang and swear words),
          Angele (Belgian artist, socially conscious and excellent French music), il Capitale Umano (2014 Italian film, super interesting storytelling).

      <h2>Some Projects I've Worked on</h2>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/amberxie88/MusicAnalysis">Lyrical Statistics</a></h3>
      <p>While music itself is freeform and artistic, there's a lot of science behind the music, lyrics, and what makes it work. I continued off on another Github repository's work on analyzing lyrical composition,
        trying it out with some artists I've listened to. Still working on developing more features.
      </p>

      <h3><a href="https://eternalvirtualsunshine.weebly.com/project-3.html">Free Speech on the Internet</a></h3>
      <p>This is a collection of papers and drafts I wrote for one of my favorite courses at Berkeley: college writing on technology and society. 
          In a world where technology is prevalent, and especially as someone engaged in the tech space, it's important to recognize the effects it has on the world.
          Mostly, it was just really fun and interesting to read deeply into a lot of issues that really fascinated me, such as the NBA / Daryl Morey / Hong Kong / China controversey.

      <h3><a href="https://cs170.org/assets/project/spec.pdf">NP-Hard Algorithmic Problem</a></h3>
      <p>Created a randomized algorithm to solve the provided NP-hard problem. The problem consists of finding a "spanning" tree that minimizes average pairwise distance. Caveat: 
          the tree doesn't have to span all the vertices. As long as all vertices are in or have a neighbor in the tree, you're good. Implemented a gradient-descent algorithm in 
          Python to find an approximately good solution for small, medium, and large inputs.
